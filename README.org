* markov-twit

** Description
A small project using Markov chains and the Twitter and Reddit api to generate tweets and Reddit comments in the style of a particular user, or posts and titles for a given subreddit. The code is based on [[http://howistart.org/posts/clojure/1/]].

** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(generate-tweet "TwitterUser" 10)
#+END_SRC
Pulls the 200 most recent tweets from the timeline of @TwitterUser, creates a Markov chain and walks the chain 10 times to generate new tweets, starting each time from the beginning of a random tweet.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(generate-reddit-comment "RedditUser" 10)
(generate-reddit-title "Subreddit" 10)
(generate-reddit-post "Subreddit" 10)
#+END_SRC
Exactly the same, except they use the Reddit API to pull 200 comments, titles or posts respectively to generate the Markov chain.

** Setup
The project was created using [[https://leiningen.org/][Leiningen]]. To get Twitter integration to work, you need a =profiles.clj= file in the project root directory, containing the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
{:dev  {:env {:app-consumer-key "twitter-key"
              :app-consumer-secret "twitter-secret"
              :user-access-token "twitter-key-2"
              :user-access-secret "twitter-secret-2"}}}
#+END_SRC
A guide for how to get the values to put in this file can be found [[http://howistart.org/posts/clojure/1/#hooking-the-bot-up-to-twitter][here]].
